check anki documentation, there is a whole thing for how their card review scedules are set and it can be made unique to each deck

AnkAi Handover

  Project: Language learning app using Anki flashcards as vocabulary source. Translates articles to Chinese using only words the user knows from their Anki decks.

  Stack: FastAPI backend + React/TypeScript frontend + AnkiConnect API

  Current Task: Adding review intervals to word popup buttons (like Anki shows "<1m", "10m", "1d", etc.)

  The Problem:
  - AnkiConnect's getIntervals with complete=true returns different formats:
    - Review cards: exactly 4 values [4, 31, 173, 463] → works
    - Learning cards: many values with negatives (seconds) and positives (days) [-60, -600, 1, 2, 3...]
    - New cards: just 0

  Current Bug: Some cards show duplicate values (e.g., "5m", "5m", "1d", "4d") because the extraction logic doesn't handle all edge cases properly.

  Key Files:
  - /home/jamie/Documents/AnkAi/backend/main.py - get_card_intervals() endpoint around line 159
  - /home/jamie/Documents/AnkAi/frontend/src/components/WordPopup.tsx - displays intervals on buttons

  What's Needed: Fix the interval extraction logic to always return 4 distinct values for Again/Hard/Good/Easy buttons.
